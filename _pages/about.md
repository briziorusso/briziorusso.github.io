I have been building AI models for the last ten years. Models to automate decisions, models to comply with regulations, models to forecast outcomes and make better decisions. 

My research interests are towards Statistical Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), Causality and Computational Argumentation with a focus towards knowledge discovery and human-AI integration for high-stakes decision making.

I have worked for 6 years in the credit risk industry, leaving my job as Head of Data Science for [4most Europe](https://www.4-most.co.uk/machine-learning) in September 2020 to pursue a PhD in Computer Science. 

At 4most, I worked with tens of clients over the years, delivering modelling solutions for different problems within Credit Risk. Currently, I am in the [Computational Logic and Argumentation group](https://clarg.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). I am also part of the Safe and Trusted AI Centre for Doctoral Training [(STAI)](https://safeandtrustedai.org).

Additionally, I help organising the [Explainable AI Seminars @ Imperial](http://xaiseminars.doc.ic.ac.uk/), a great forum to learn and stay up to date with all things XAI.
