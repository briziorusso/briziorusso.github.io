Hi there! 
I am a PhD student in the [Computational Logic and Argumentation group](https://clarg.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at
[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). I am also part of the Safe and Trusted AI Centre for Doctoral Training [(STAI)](https://safeandtrustedai.org). My research interests are towards Explainable AI (XAI) and Statistical Learning.

Prior to starting my PhD I have worked as a Credit Risk Consultant for 5 years, leaving my job as Head of Data Science for [4most Europe](https://www.4-most.co.uk/about). There I worked with tens of clients over the years, delivering model solutions for Credit Risk. Check out my [CV](CV) to know more.
