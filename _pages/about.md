I am currently studying towards a PhD in Computer Science in the [Computational Logic and Argumentation group](https://clarg.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at
[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). I am also part of the Safe and Trusted AI Centre for Doctoral Training [(STAI)](https://safeandtrustedai.org). My research interests are towards Explainable AI (XAI) and Statistical Learning.

I am an economist by training (BSc Economics from University of Rome, Tor Vergata) but then went on focusing on Stats (MSc Applied Statistics from University of London, Birkbeck).

Prior to starting my PhD I have worked for 6 years in the credit risk industry, leaving my job as Head of Data Science for [4most Europe](https://www.4-most.co.uk/machine-learning) in September 2020. At 4most I worked with tens of clients over the years, delivering modelling solutions for different problems within Credit Risk.
